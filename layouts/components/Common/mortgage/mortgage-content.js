              Using the TaxMustache mortgage calculator is very simple, first
              you must enter the price of the house, if you do not have the
              final price try to find an approximate one, it is important to
              note that within the price of the house there may be additional
              costs related to the purchase process as well as administrative
              costs and disbursement by the bank. For this, we invite you to
              read our in-depth article on Types of Mortgages.
            </div>
            <br />
            <div>
              Under &quot;Down Payment&quot;, enter the amount of your down
              payment (if you are buying) or the amount of equity you have (if
              you are refinancing). The down payment is the money you pay up
              front for a home, also known as a down payment, and the principal
              is the value of the home minus what you owe.
            </div>
            <br />
            <div>
              In the section called &quot;Interest Rate&quot; proceed to enter
              the interest rate the bank has given you, if you don&#39;t know it
              you can use an approximate one, so you will have a general idea of
              the payment.&nbsp; In the last section, called &quot;Loan
              Term&quot;, use the drop-down to select the number of years for
              which the mortgage loan will be agreed, normally 20, 25 or 30
              years maximum are used. Next, to the right (if you are on desktop)
              or at the bottom (if you are on mobile) you will see an
              approximate monthly amount to be paid for your mortgage, as well
              as the balance of interest and principal, which is represented in
              a pie chart.

            <h2>Formula for calculating the mortgage payments</h2>
            <br />
            <div>
              The calculation of the mortgage installment is as follows: M = P [
              i [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1].
            </div>

            <dv>The variables are as follows</dv>

            <ul className="max-w-md list-inside list-disc space-y-1 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
              <li>M = monthly mortgage payment</li>
              <li>P = principal amount</li>
              <li>
                i = the monthly interest rate. The financial institution is
                likely to report interest rates as an annual rate amount, so to
                know the average, you must divide the amount over 12 months.. So
                if the interest rate is 5%, the monthly interest rate will be
                0.05/12 = 0.004167.
              </li>
              <li>
                n = number of payments over the term of the loan. If you take
                out a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loan, this means: n = 30 years
                x 12 months per year, or 360 payments.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How a TaxMustache mortgage calculator can help you</h3>
            <br />
            <div>
              Determining your monthly mortgage payment for your home is an
              important part of knowing how much you can afford and how much you
              can borrow. This monthly payment is likely to make up the majority
              of your cost of living.
            </div>
            <br />
            <div>
              The mortgage payment calculator allows you to calculate your
              mortgage payment when you buy a home or refinance. You can change
              the loan details on the calculator to run scripts. The computer
              can help you decide:
            </div>

            <div>
              A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage reduces your monthly payment, but
              you&#39;ll pay more interest over the life of the loan. A 15-year
              fixed-rate mortgage reduces the total interest you&#39;ll pay, but
              your monthly payment will be higher.

              <span class="font-medium">Important:</span> Buying a home requires
              in many cases an economic sacrifice, so we recommend avoiding
              unnecessary expenses and focus on paying the house in the shortest
              time possible, this will allow you to access lower interest rates.
              Although it is clear that this depends on the financial capacity
              of each person.

              Whether a variable rate mortgage is a good option. Adjustable rate
              mortgages start with a &quot;teaser&quot; rate, and then the
              interest rate on the loan changes (increases or decreases) over
              time. A 5/1 ARM may be a good option, especially if you plan to
              live in a house for only a few years. You should consider how much
              your monthly mortgage payment may change when the original
              interest rate comes due, especially if interest rates tend to
              rise.

              If you put enough money down. Now that the minimum down payment is
              usually 3%, it is easier than ever to make a small down payment,
              the larger the down payment, the lower the monthly payment and the
              lower the mortgage interest rate.

              What is the bank&#39;s procedure for deciding how much money to

            <div>
              Mortgage lenders are required to evaluate your ability to repay
              the amount you want to borrow. Many factors are involved in that
              assessment, the primary one being your debt-to-income ratio.
            </div>

            <div>
              It should be noted that, the debt-to-income ratio is obtained by
              the percentage of income you earn before taxes, which is earmarked
              for monthly debt repayment, this includes but is not limited to:
              Mortgage, car payment, student loans, credit card payments, and
              child support (if any).
              <br />
            </div>
            <br />
            <div>
              Lenders look best at a debt-to-income ratio of 36% or lower, i.e.,
              a maximum of $1,800 per month on an income of $5,000 per month
              before taxes.

            <h3>Typical Costs Included in a Mortgage Payment</h3>

            <div>
              If your mortgage payment included only principal and interest, you
              could use a basic mortgage calculator. But most mortgage payments
              include other expenses as well.&nbsp;

              <li>
                This is the principal balance you have borrowed; each monthly
                payment reduces (after interest) the principal amount of the
                debt.

                What the lender charges you for lending you the money. It is
                important to note that the interest payment is reflected on an
                annual basis.

                The annual tax charged by a government authority on your home
                and land. You pay about one-twelfth of the annual tax with each
                mortgage payment, and the servicer holds it in an escrow
                account.&nbsp;

                storms, theft, a tree falling on your home, and other
                misfortunes. As with property taxes, you pay approximately
                one-twelfth of the annual premium each month, and the servicer
                pays the bill when due.

              <li>
                Mortgage Insurance: If the down payment is less than 20% of the
                purchase price of the home, you will probably have to pay
                mortgage insurance. It protects the lender&#39;s interest in
                case the borrower defaults on the mortgage.
