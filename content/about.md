15 years ago I moved from New York to San Jose, Costa Rica, one of the main reasons I left my hometown was the love I have for nature and learning more about other cultures. Although, living in San Jose is cheaper than in New York, the difference is not too much, I mean, if you live in San Jose in a popular neighborhood, the rent can cost you $2500/month, at that time I was working as a software developer for Intel (which has a factory in Costa Rica).

At that time Intel gave me the opportunity to work from Costa Rica, so I did not hesitate twice to move to this tropical country which I love. I have never been a party person, but I did spend a lot of money on rides, car, rent, etc. My salary at that time was $5500 dollars a month, a salary considered very good in Costa Rica, this included social security (CCSS).

In 2016 I had serious financial problems and incredibly my salary of $5500 was no longer enough to live on, in 2017 I got married, in 2018 my financial situation was a little worse. So at that time I decided to take the reins of my personal finances and start to get out of that financial hole I had put myself in.

In 2020 I managed to pay off my debts, stabilize myself financially and have a better quality of life. At the end of 2022 a friend contacted me to ask for advice on how to get out of debt and improve his financial situation (I forgot to mention that in 2017 - 2019 I studied finance at a university in Costa Rica) after helping my friend, he has improved a lot in his finances and although in 2023 he still has a long way to go to pay off his debts, my friend has told me that he found my advice very helpful.

That is why, I thought of creating this website, in which I can share financial information, which can help many people who are going through a complicated financial situation, as it happened to me several times before 2020.
