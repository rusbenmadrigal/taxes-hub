According to the American philosophy of **ability-to-pay taxation**, ability-to-pay taxation holds that taxes should be levied based on each taxpayer's ability to pay. The idea is that individuals, businesses and corporations with higher incomes can and should pay more taxes.

### **Highlights**

**1: The ability-to-pay principle holds that those with a greater ability to pay taxes-as measured by income and wealth-should pay more.**

**2: One of the ideas behind "ability to pay" is that those who have enjoyed success should be willing to give a little more back to the society that helped make that success possible.**

**3:Proponents of "ability to pay" argue that, ultimately, a single dollar means less to a wealthy person than it does to a wage earner, so the wealthy should pay more to match their sacrifice.**

### **The ability-to-pay principle**

Ability-to-pay taxation holds that those earning higher incomes should pay a higher percentage of that income in taxes compared to those earning less. For example, in 2020, individuals with taxable incomes below $9,875 faced a 10% tax rate, while those with taxable incomes above $518,000 faced a rate of 37%, the highest individual rate in the country. Incomes between those amounts face tax rates set by income brackets.

The idea behind ability-to-pay is that everyone should make the same sacrifice when it comes to paying taxes, and since people with more money effectively have less use for a given dollar, paying more of them in taxes does not impose a greater burden. Think of it this way: For a person making $1 million a year, $10,000 will make very little difference in his or her lifetime, while it will make a big difference for a person making only $60,000 a year.

### **History of the Ability-to-Pay Tax**

The idea of a progressive income tax - that is, that people with the ability to pay more pay a higher percentage of their income - is centuries old. In fact, it was advocated by none other than Adam Smith, considered the father of economics, in 1776.

Smith wrote: "The subjects of every State ought to contribute to the support of the government, as far as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the income they respectively enjoy under the protection of the State."

### **Arguments in favor of progressive taxation.**

Proponents of ability-to-pay taxes argue that those who have benefited most from the nation's way of life in the form of higher incomes and greater wealth can afford and should be required to pay back a little more to keep the system going.

The argument is that the society that government tax revenues have helped build-infrastructure such as highways and fiber optic communications networks, a strong military, public schools, a free market system-provides the environment in which their success is possible and in which they can continue to enjoy that success.

### **Criticism of ability-to-pay taxes**

Critics of progressive taxation argue that it is fundamentally unfair. They say it penalizes hard work and success and reduces the incentive to earn more money. Many argue that everyone should pay the same income tax - a "flat tax" - to make the system more equitable.

### **Progressive taxation and inequality**

Although the United States continues to maintain a progressive tax system, tax rates for the wealthy have plummeted in recent decades. When President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, the top personal income tax bracket was 70%. In 2020, the top rate for incomes is 37%. Meanwhile, inequality has reached levels not seen in at least a century. The richest 1% now own more wealth than the poorest 90%.
