The belief that there is only one optimal day a week to save on flights - and that day is Tuesday - is a legend, but today we'll show you that other days are also favorable for travel to and from the United States. And like any good legend, there's some truth to it... but it's not the whole story.

The reality is that flight prices are constantly changing at any time of the day, depending on a variety of factors, especially the demand for space, which adjusts to demand in real time. Keep in mind that airlines do not restock on the same day week after week, so you won't get a bargain if you wait until Tuesday to book, as there may be events that raise the price for that specific day. However, you may find some savings if you are willing to fly on a Tuesday or Wednesday, as long as there is not some kind of special event during those days, e.g., a concert, unexpected vacation, some major event.

#### You should keep in mind

Just because it's a Tuesday doesn't mean that tickets will be at a great price. If there is an event on that Tuesday that causes an increase in demand for flights, this will cause your ticket prices to increase even more than on weekends.

### The Best Days to Book a Flight

There is no best day of the week to actually book a flight. You can find deals any day of the week, as flight prices fluctuate depending on supply and demand.

Airlines may offer discounts, increase the number of seats on a route or even reduce prices to match a competitor, so there is no real pattern as to which day of the week has the best deals.

#### So... when is the best day to fly?

According to data provided by Hopper (a travel booking app) from January to May 2022, for April departures. Here's a chart of what data highlights about the best day to book a flight.

#### The best days to book domestic flights

The cheapest days to fly within the US are weekdays, usually Tuesday or Wednesday.

For economy class bookings, Tuesdays could save you up to 24% compared to Sundays, which translates to a savings of approximately $85 per person.

*   The same is generally true for business and first-class travelers.
*   You can consider booking Saturday or Monday flights to avoid the Sunday rush and save some bucks.

Saturdays and Mondays are the cheapest days to fly after weekday flights. The average airfare is between 13% and 15% lower these days. This means that if you move your trip a day earlier or later than Sunday, you'll usually save about $50 per ticket.

#### Wednesdays and Thursdays are the cheapest days to fly internationally.

Meanwhile, international travelers would be wise to depart on Wednesday, which is the cheapest day for international travel. That said, there is not much difference in prices between different days of the week.

If you fly on Wednesday, you will only save 12% compared to the most expensive day (Sunday) and compared to the 24% difference between the cheapest and most expensive day for domestic flights.

### **Tips for finding cheap flights any day of the week**

#### 1: Book one to three months in advance

While there's no specific day of the week when flights are always cheaper, there is a period of time when it's worth booking before prices go up.

Scott's Cheap Flights, an online newsletter with flight deals, [recommends](https://taxmustache.com/posts/mortgage-rates) booking domestic flights one to three months in advance to avoid any price increases in the weeks before departure. Last-minute flight deals are rare, and you risk missing out because the flight you want may sell out completely. If you're flying abroad, look two to eight months in advance.

#### 2: Set up a price alert

Instead of checking flight prices daily, set up a price alert on your preferred travel search engine, whether it's Google Flights, Hopper, Skyscanner or [Kayak](https://www.kayak.com/). They'll email you when they see the price has dropped.

#### 3: Re-book if you find a cheaper price

Most airlines have adopted more flexible change and cancellation policies, which makes it easier to rebook your flight to save money.

First, you should make sure that the original flight you booked doesn't have any change or cancellation fees. For most airlines, this applies to most domestic flights (unless you've booked basic economy class) and some short-haul international flights.

Then, if you find a better deal, you can cancel your flight and rebook (on the same or another airline) to get a cheaper price. Note that if you cancel, you may only get one travel voucher or credit, so only use this option if you're sure you'll fly again with the original airline within a year.

#### 4: Be flexible on destination, airport and dates

The golden rule of cheap travel remains: be flexible. Use Google Flights to see if there are cheaper places to go by leaving the destination field blank when searching. Check nearby airports if you've decided on a destination. And use calendar views to find lower prices on different dates. After all, the best day to book a flight and the best day to fly is when it's cheapest, and that can vary depending on when and where you're going.
