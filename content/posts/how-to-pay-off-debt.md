We all had or have debts at one time or another. The reality is that, nowadays, many of the goods we want to acquire need a financial commitment to achieve what we want. For example, if we want to buy a car, we may be able to find a second-hand one, but maybe it is not the one we want, so we resort to a credit to buy a new car from a dealer.

The same can happen with many other examples. The reality is that our current economy is based on debt, and in some cases debt can be considered as "good debt", since it allows us to acquire what we want to buy and at which, we still do not have all the necessary money, with the option to pay at a certain time, adding a percentage to the capital doubt, which is known as debt interest.

### When is there a problem?

The origin by which many people (including myself) came to have financial problems, begin when the person gets over indebted, begins to make minimum payments to their credit cards, borrow money to go on a trip, acquires goods that you do not really need, etc.

> Debts can be considered "good debts" as long as they have a low interest rate and the payment does not interfere with your other expenses, i.e., it does not mean that you will be over-indebted.

In my personal case, I got to have a salary of $5,500 net monthly, living in Costa Rica (as a digital nomad) and still the salary was not enough, I worked for 2 companies in the USA, remotely, but my debts and personal loans with different entities in USA did not allow me to enjoy that money, which in a country like Costa Rica would be supposed to live better than in my native New York; however, it was not so, and this was due to my personal debts, which had exceeded my maximum power of indebtedness.

It is for that reason that today I decided to publish this article, which seeks to help other people who are going through a similar situation in which I was a few years ago.

#### 1: Calculate your real budget

Knowing your income and expenses can help you know if you have money left over to pay your debts. Paying more than the minimum each month, whether with your credit card or personal loan, can speed up the repayment process.

As you focus on paying off debt, work to build an emergency fund. Even a small one can keep you from going further into debt if an unexpected expense comes up. It's always good to have an emergency fund, and it's going to depend on the expenses you have on a monthly basis.

#### 2: Reduce your expenses

Cutting expenses, such as streaming services, ordering food delivery or going without an expensive phone, can make it all add up quickly. It's amazing how much money you can spend on services like Uber Eats. This can also affect your health if you're eating too much junk food.

In my personal case, in 2021 I spent up to $600 dollars a month on Uber Eats, remember that I live in Costa Rica and with that amount of money a family can eat for up to two months. That amount of money would have been better spent on a more important expense, such as rent or paying credit cards.

Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with spending once a week on food delivery like Uber Eats, but when you order delivery service 3 times a day, every day of the month, that's when there is a problem.

#### 3: Stop using your credit cards

Stopping your debt from growing can make it easier to manage. One way is to stop using credit cards.

Not running up a balance while you're paying off debt can also help improve your credit utilization - or the ratio of your debt balance to your available credit - which is an important factor in calculating your credit score and interest due. The lower your credit utilization, the better it will reflect on your credit score.

#### 4: Seek extra income and cash

Gathering extra income can increase the amount you can put toward your debt, accelerating your repayment.

Look for legitimate side jobs. Some jobs can be completed in less than an hour, such as user testing for websites and apps. Others, such as freelancing, will take you longer, but can earn you more money.

For example, I am a software developer and what I have done is, in my off hours I do additional work in addition to my main job, this has allowed me to generate an additional $2500, which has improved my financial situation.

Finding extra money can also help you reduce expenses. And consider using some or all of a windfall, such as a tax refund or a bonus from work, to make a one-time payment on debt.

#### 5: Find a payment method to stick to

Paying off debt is a financial and psychological commitment. Just as you have to have the money to pay what you owe, you also have to find a payment method that works for you.

If a few small quick wins early in the process will help keep you motivated, the debt snowball method may be right for you. With this tactic, you allocate as much extra money as you can to pay off the smallest debt first (while covering at least the minimums on the other debts). Once paid off, you invest the money that had been earmarked for the first debt into paying off the next largest debt, and so on, until all debts are paid off.

But if you're more into delaying gratification and [saving a little money](https://taxmustache.com/mortgage-calculator), the debt avalanche method may be for you. With this strategy, you focus on paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first. Always focusing on wiping out the debt with the highest interest can save you money overall and can also speed up your debt-free date.

#### 6: Consider Debt Consolidation

Bundling multiple debts into one payment (ideally with a lower interest rate) through debt consolidation can make your debt easier to manage and less costly overall. The less you have to pay in interest, the more money you can put toward reducing the underlying debt.

A credit card with a 0% interest balance transfer or a debt consolidation loan are two solid options for debt consolidation. Keep in mind that you will likely need a good credit score to qualify for them. Also, each lender sets its own requirements, and credit score may be just one piece of the puzzle.

#### 7: Know when to quit

Sometimes debt can be too much. If you're finding it difficult to keep [paying](https://taxmustache.com/posts/ability-to-pay-taxation) your debts and your total debt exceeds 50% of your gross annual income, it may be time to seek outside help.

Debt relief options, such as debt management plans from a nonprofit credit counseling agency and bankruptcy, can give you the relief you need to put your debts behind you. Otherwise, paying off what you owe could take years and get in the way of other financial goals, such as saving for retirement or a down payment on a home.
