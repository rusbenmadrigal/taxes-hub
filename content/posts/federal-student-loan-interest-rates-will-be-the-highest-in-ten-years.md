Prepare your wallet for higher interest payments when applying for a college loan in 2023 - 2024, as federal student loan interest rates will be approximately 5.50%. For this reason, graduate students and parents will experience a higher interest rate cost.

According to information provided by [NerdWallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/student-loans/interest-rates-on-federal-student-loans-to-be-highest-in-decade), the university will hit deeper into the pocket of students who apply for a loan during 2023 - 2024, this is because the federal student loan interest rate will rise to levels not seen in the last 10a nos.

July 1, 2023, begins the interest rate increase for students taking out new federal Direct student loans. According to the data provided, the interest rate increase is 5.50%, as confirmed Tuesday by the Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid. So the increase is significant when compared to the 2022 - 2023 (4.99%) and 2021 - 2022 (3.73%).

On the other hand, the interest rate of direct loans for graduates, which are available to graduates and professionals, will have an increase of 0.51%, that is, from 6.54% to 7.05%. PLUS loans, which are used by parents and graduate students to fill education funding gaps, have increased from 7.54% to 8.05% thus increasing by +0.51% during the 2023 academic year. Importantly, these are the higher 2023 - 2024 interest rates for each of the federal student loan types compared to the 2022 - 2023 interest rates.

**In summary, the student loan interest rate increases are as follows.**

*   Undergraduate Direct Loans: from 4.99% to 5.50% (+0.51%)
*   Graduate Direct Loans: from 6.54% to 7.05% (+0.51%)
*   PLUS loans: from 7.54% to 8.05% (+0.51%)

According to historical data, interest rates for direct undergraduate student loans had not been this high since 2013. On the other hand, interest rates for graduate direct loans, as well as PLUS [loans](https://taxmustache.com/posts/how-to-pay-off-debt), which were introduced in 2006 with rates, had never registered such an aggressive increase as we see in 2023.

### Higher Interest Rates, More Expensive College

With higher interest rates, paying off a student loan will cost more money. Every academic year, in mid to late May, the government proceeds to set new interest rates for the next year's student loans by proceeding to add the yield from auctions of 10-year U.S. Treasury notes. So, the new interest rates are applied to new student loans starting July 1 of each academic year.

Most troubling is that raising interest rates, will make college much more expensive for the millions of college students and of course their families who borrow. According to the data, currently, approximately 44 million students collectively owe approximately $1.6 trillion in outstanding federal student loans. Keep in mind that student loans account for 93% of the total student debt burden in the United States, according to the analysis published by NerdWallet based on data from the Department of Education and the Federal Reserve.

#### Let's take a practical example

If a student starts college in the fall and applies for a total of $31,000 in unsubsidized federal direct loans (which is the maximum amount for dependent undergraduate students) with an interest rate of 5.50%, the student will end up paying almost $50,000 with a standard 10-year annual payment plan interest rate. If the same student had started college in 2020 - 2021 and applied for the loan for the same amount of money with the 2.75% interest rate they would have had to pay approximately $39,000 including interest over 10 years.

**Loan requested in 2020 - 2021**

*   31,000 + 2.75% x 10 years = $39,525

**Loan requested in 2022 - 2023**

*   $31,000 + 5.50% x 10 years = $48,050

The higher interest rates will be applied to all new college or graduate school loans beginning fall 2023 - 2024. It is important to note that all federal student loans have fixed interest rates, meaning that these rates will not fluctuate during the stated repayment period.
