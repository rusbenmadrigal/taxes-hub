Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting to plain text documents. Use the **Source** button to check and edit the Markdown source code of this content.\n\nThe editor-produced Markdown output supports most essential features, like [links](https://ckeditor.com/), **different** kinds of _emphasis_, `inline code formatting`, or code blocks:\n\n```css\np {\n    text-align: center;\n    color: red;\n}\n```\n\n## Markdown input ðŸ›¬\n\nThanks to the [autoformatting feature](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/autoformat.html), you can use Markdown syntax when writing. Try it out - use these (or any other) Markdown shortcuts in the editor to format the content on the fly ðŸš€!\n\n| Inline formatting | Shortcut |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Bold** | Type `**` or `__` around your text. |\n| _Italic_ | Type `*` or `_` around your text. |\n| `Code` | Type `Ë‹` around your text. |\n| ~Strikethrough~ | Type `~~` around your text. |\n\nShh! ðŸ¤« Markdown has very basic support for tables. Some advanced table-related features like table or cell styling were disabled in this demo.\n\n## Block formatting\n\nYou can also use Markdown to create various text blocks, such as:\n\n*   Block quotes - Start a line with `ï¹¥` followed by a space.\n*   Headings:\n    1.  Heading 1 - Start a line with `#` followed by a space.\n    2.  Heading 2 - Start a line with `##` followed by a space.\n    3.  Heading 3 - Start a line with `###` followed by a space.\n*   Lists, including nested ones:\n    *   Numbered lists - Start a line with `1.` or `1)` followed by a space.\n    *   Bulleted lists - Start a line with `*` or `-` followed by a space.\n    *   To-do lists - Start a line with `[ ]` or `[x]` followed by a space to insert an unchecked or checked list item.\n*   Code blocks - Start a line with `Ë‹Ë‹Ë‹`.\n*   Horizontal lines - Start a line with `---`","slug":"post-1"}]
