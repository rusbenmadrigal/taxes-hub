Discover how it works and why it's important.","date":"2023-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/post/taxation.jpeg","categories":["taxes"],"featured":true,"author":"Tax Mustache Team","draft":false},"content":"\nAccording to the American philosophy of **ability-to-pay taxation**, ability-to-pay taxation holds that taxes should be levied based on each taxpayer's ability to pay. The idea is that individuals, businesses and corporations with higher incomes can and should pay more taxes.\n\n### **Highlights**\n\n**1: The ability-to-pay principle holds that those with a greater ability to pay taxes-as measured by income and wealth-should pay more.**\n\n**2: One of the ideas behind \"ability to pay\" is that those who have enjoyed success should be willing to give a little more back to the society that helped make that success possible.**\n\n**3:Proponents of \"ability to pay\" argue that, ultimately, a single dollar means less to a wealthy person than it does to a wage earner, so the wealthy should pay more to match their sacrifice.**\n\n### **The ability-to-pay principle**\n\nAbility-to-pay taxation holds that those earning higher incomes should pay a higher percentage of that income in taxes compared to those earning less. For example, in 2020, individuals with taxable incomes below $9,875 faced a 10% tax rate, while those with taxable incomes above $518,000 faced a rate of 37%, the highest individual rate in the country. Incomes between those amounts face tax rates set by income brackets.\n\nThe idea behind ability-to-pay is that everyone should make the same sacrifice when it comes to paying taxes, and since people with more money effectively have less use for a given dollar, paying more of them in taxes does not impose a greater burden. Think of it this way: For a person making $1 million a year, $10,000 will make very little difference in his or her lifetime, while it will make a big difference for a person making only $60,000 a year.\n\n### **History of the Ability-to-Pay Tax**\n\nThe idea of a progressive income tax - that is, that people with the ability to pay more pay a higher percentage of their income - is centuries old. In fact, it was advocated by none other than Adam Smith, considered the father of economics, in 1776.\n\nSmith wrote: \"The subjects of every State ought to contribute to the support of the government, as far as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the income they respectively enjoy under the protection of the State.\"\n\n### **Arguments in favor of progressive taxation.**\n\nProponents of ability-to-pay taxes argue that those who have benefited most from the nation's way of life in the form of higher incomes and greater wealth can afford and should be required to pay back a little more to keep the system going.\n\nThe argument is that the society that government tax revenues have helped build-infrastructure such as highways and fiber optic communications networks, a strong military, public schools, a free market system-provides the environment in which their success is possible and in which they can continue to enjoy that success.\n\n### **Criticism of ability-to-pay taxes**\n\nCritics of progressive taxation argue that it is fundamentally unfair. They say it penalizes hard work and success and reduces the incentive to earn more money. Many argue that everyone should pay the same income tax - a \"flat tax\" - to make the system more equitable.\n\n### **Progressive taxation and inequality**\n\nAlthough the United States continues to maintain a progressive tax system, tax rates for the wealthy have plummeted in recent decades. When President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, the top personal income tax bracket was 70%. In 2020, the top rate for incomes is 37%. Meanwhile, inequality has reached levels not seen in at least a century. The richest 1% now own more wealth than the poorest 90%.\n\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://taxmustache.com/posts/ability-to-pay-taxation\" />","slug":"ability-to-pay-taxation"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Discover the Best Days to Book a Flight and Save Big!","description":"Want to save money on your next flight? Learn about the best days to book flights and find the cheapest deals for your next trip.","date":"2023-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/post/plane.jpg","categories":["travel"],"featured":true,"author":"Tax Mustache Team","draft":false},"content":"\nThe belief that there is only one optimal day a week to save on flights - and that day is Tuesday - is a legend, but today we'll show you that other days are also favorable for travel to and from the United States. And like any good legend, there's some truth to it... but it's not the whole story.\n\nThe reality is that flight prices are constantly changing at any time of the day, depending on a variety of factors, especially the demand for space, which adjusts to demand in real time. Keep in mind that airlines do not restock on the same day week after week, so you won't get a bargain if you wait until Tuesday to book, as there may be events that raise the price for that specific day. However, you may find some savings if you are willing to fly on a Tuesday or Wednesday, as long as there is not some kind of special event during those days, e.g., a concert, unexpected vacation, some major event.\n\n### You should keep in mind\n\n> Just because it's a Tuesday doesn't mean that tickets will be at a great price. If there is an event on that Tuesday that causes an increase in demand for flights, this will cause your ticket prices to increase even more than on weekends.\n\n### The Best Days to Book a Flight\n\nThere is no best day of the week to actually book a flight. You can find deals any day of the week, as flight prices fluctuate depending on supply and demand.\n\nAirlines may offer discounts, increase the number of seats on a route or even reduce prices to match a competitor, so there is no real pattern as to which day of the week has the best deals.\n\n#### So... when is the best day to fly?\n\nAccording to data provided by Hopper (a travel booking app) from January to May 2022, for April departures. Here's a chart of what data highlights about the best day to book a flight.\n\n![](https://33333.cdn.cke-cs.com/kSW7V9NHUXugvhoQeFaf/images/567f95ae4a90e6a0aecdf43368f15f6fb6d197a736772253.png)\n\n#### The best days to book domestic flights\n\nThe cheapest days to fly within the US are weekdays, usually Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nFor economy class bookings, Tuesdays could save you up to 24% compared to Sundays, which translates to a savings of approximately $85 per person.\n\n*   The same is generally true for business and first-class travelers.\n*   You can consider booking Saturday or Monday flights to avoid the Sunday rush and save some bucks.\n\nSaturdays and Mondays are the cheapest days to fly after weekday flights. The average airfare is between 13% and 15% lower these days. This means that if you move your trip a day earlier or later than Sunday, you'll usually save about $50 per ticket.\n\n![](https://33333.cdn.cke-cs.com/kSW7V9NHUXugvhoQeFaf/images/d4b287c0928ea454bc3ed39a002ea666d6cc2a17e2f4391f.png)\n\n#### Wednesdays and Thursdays are the cheapest days to fly internationally.\n\nMeanwhile, international travelers would be wise to depart on Wednesday, which is the cheapest day for international travel. That said, there is not much difference in prices between different days of the week.\n\nIf you fly on Wednesday, you will only save 12% compared to the most expensive day (Sunday) and compared to the 24% difference between the cheapest and most expensive day for domestic flights.\n\n### **Tips for finding cheap flights any day of the week**\n\n#### 1: Book one to three months in advance\n\nWhile there's no specific day of the week when flights are always cheaper, there is a period of time when it's worth booking before prices go up.\n\nScott's Cheap Flights, an online newsletter with flight deals, [recommends](https://taxmustache.com/posts/mortgage-rates) booking domestic flights one to three months in advance to avoid any price increases in the weeks before departure. Last-minute flight deals are rare, and you risk missing out because the flight you want may sell out completely. If you're flying abroad, look two to eight months in advance.\n\n#### 2: Set up a price alert\n\nInstead of checking flight prices daily, set up a price alert on your preferred travel search engine, whether it's Google Flights, Hopper, Skyscanner or [Kayak](https://www.kayak.com/). They'll email you when they see the price has dropped.\n\n#### 3: Re-book if you find a cheaper price\n\nMost airlines have adopted more flexible change and cancellation policies, which makes it easier to rebook your flight to save money.\n\nFirst, you should make sure that the original flight you booked doesn't have any change or cancellation fees. For most airlines, this applies to most domestic flights (unless you've booked basic economy class) and some short-haul international flights.\n\nThen, if you find a better deal, you can cancel your flight and rebook (on the same or another airline) to get a cheaper price. Note that if you cancel, you may only get one travel voucher or credit, so only use this option if you're sure you'll fly again with the original airline within a year.\n\n#### 4: Be flexible on destination, airport and dates\n\nThe golden rule of cheap travel remains: be flexible. Use Google Flights to see if there are cheaper places to go by leaving the destination field blank when searching. Check nearby airports if you've decided on a destination. And use calendar views to find lower prices on different dates. After all, the best day to book a flight and the best day to fly is when it's cheapest, and that can vary depending on when and where you're going.\n\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://taxmustache.com/posts/best-days-to-book-a-flight\" />","slug":"best-days-to-book-a-flight"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Interest Rates on Federal Student Loans to Be Highest in Decade","description":"Student loans come with a significant interest rate increase starting in the fall of 2023.","date":"2023-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/post/student-loan.jpg","categories":["news"],"featured":true,"author":"Tax Mustache Team","draft":false},"content":"\nPrepare your wallet for higher interest payments when applying for a college loan in 2023 - 2024, as federal student loan interest rates will be approximately 5.50%. For this reason, graduate students and parents will experience a higher interest rate cost.\n\nAccording to information provided by [NerdWallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/student-loans/interest-rates-on-federal-student-loans-to-be-highest-in-decade), the university will hit deeper into the pocket of students who apply for a loan during 2023 - 2024, this is because the federal student loan interest rate will rise to levels not seen in the last 10a nos.\n\nJuly 1, 2023, begins the interest rate increase for students taking out new federal Direct student loans. According to the data provided, the interest rate increase is 5.50%, as confirmed Tuesday by the Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid. So the increase is significant when compared to the 2022 - 2023 (4.99%) and 2021 - 2022 (3.73%).\n\nOn the other hand, the interest rate of direct loans for graduates, which are available to graduates and professionals, will have an increase of 0.51%, that is, from 6.54% to 7.05%. PLUS loans, which are used by parents and graduate students to fill education funding gaps, have increased from 7.54% to 8.05% thus increasing by +0.51% during the 2023 academic year. Importantly, these are the higher 2023 - 2024 interest rates for each of the federal student loan types compared to the 2022 - 2023 interest rates.\n\n**In summary, the student loan interest rate increases are as follows.**\n\n*   Undergraduate Direct Loans: from 4.99% to 5.50% (+0.51%)\n*   Graduate Direct Loans: from 6.54% to 7.05% (+0.51%)\n*   PLUS loans: from 7.54% to 8.05% (+0.51%)\n\nAccording to historical data, interest rates for direct undergraduate student loans had not been this high since 2013. On the other hand, interest rates for graduate direct loans, as well as PLUS [loans](https://taxmustache.com/posts/how-to-pay-off-debt), which were introduced in 2006 with rates, had never registered such an aggressive increase as we see in 2023.\n\n### Higher Interest Rates, More Expensive College\n\nWith higher interest rates, paying off a student loan will cost more money. Every academic year, in mid to late May, the government proceeds to set new interest rates for the next year's student loans by proceeding to add the yield from auctions of 10-year U.S. Treasury notes. So, the new interest rates are applied to new student loans starting July 1 of each academic year.\n\nMost troubling is that raising interest rates, will make college much more expensive for the millions of college students and of course their families who borrow. According to the data, currently, approximately 44 million students collectively owe approximately $1.6 trillion in outstanding federal student loans. Keep in mind that student loans account for 93% of the total student debt burden in the United States, according to the analysis published by NerdWallet based on data from the Department of Education and the Federal Reserve.\n\n#### Let's take a practical example\n\nIf a student starts college in the fall and applies for a total of $31,000 in unsubsidized federal direct loans (which is the maximum amount for dependent undergraduate students) with an interest rate of 5.50%, the student will end up paying almost $50,000 with a standard 10-year annual payment plan interest rate. If the same student had started college in 2020 - 2021 and applied for the loan for the same amount of money with the 2.75% interest rate they would have had to pay approximately $39,000 including interest over 10 years.\n\n**Loan requested in 2020 - 2021**\n\n*   31,000 + 2.75% x 10 years = $39,525\n\n**Loan requested in 2022 - 2023**\n\n*   $31,000 + 5.50% x 10 years = $48,050\n\nThe higher interest rates will be applied to all new college or graduate school loans beginning fall 2023 - 2024. It is important to note that all federal student loans have fixed interest rates, meaning that these rates will not fluctuate during the stated repayment period.\n\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://taxmustache.com/posts/federal-student-loan-interest-rates-will-be-the-highest-in-ten-years\" />","slug":"federal-student-loan-interest-rates-will-be-the-highest-in-ten-years"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Pay Off Debt Quickly: 7 Expert Tips","description":"Take control of your finances and learn proven methods to pay off debt fast. Discover expert tips and strategies for debt repayment success.","date":"2023-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/post/debt.jpg","categories":["education"],"featured":false,"author":"Tax Mustache Team","draft":false},"content":"\nWe all had or have debts at one time or another. The reality is that, nowadays, many of the goods we want to acquire need a financial commitment to achieve what we want. For example, if we want to buy a car, we may be able to find a second-hand one, but maybe it is not the one we want, so we resort to a credit to buy a new car from a dealer.\n\nThe same can happen with many other examples. The reality is that our current economy is based on debt, and in some cases debt can be considered as \"good debt\", since it allows us to acquire what we want to buy and at which, we still do not have all the necessary money, with the option to pay at a certain time, adding a percentage to the capital doubt, which is known as debt interest.\n\n### When is there a problem?\n\nThe origin by which many people (including myself) came to have financial problems, begin when the person gets over indebted, begins to make minimum payments to their credit cards, borrow money to go on a trip, acquires goods that you do not really need, etc.\n\n> Debts can be considered \"good debts\" as long as they have a low interest rate and the payment does not interfere with your other expenses, i.e., it does not mean that you will be over-indebted.\n\nIn my personal case, I got to have a salary of $5,500 net monthly, living in Costa Rica (as a digital nomad) and still the salary was not enough, I worked for 2 companies in the USA, remotely, but my debts and personal loans with different entities in USA did not allow me to enjoy that money, which in a country like Costa Rica would be supposed to live better than in my native New York; however, it was not so, and this was due to my personal debts, which had exceeded my maximum power of indebtedness.\n\nIt is for that reason that today I decided to publish this article, which seeks to help other people who are going through a similar situation in which I was a few years ago.\n\n#### 1: Calculate your real budget\n\nKnowing your income and expenses can help you know if you have money left over to pay your debts. Paying more than the minimum each month, whether with your credit card or personal loan, can speed up the repayment process.\n\nAs you focus on paying off debt, work to build an emergency fund. Even a small one can keep you from going further into debt if an unexpected expense comes up. It's always good to have an emergency fund, and it's going to depend on the expenses you have on a monthly basis.\n\n#### 2: Reduce your expenses\n\nCutting expenses, such as streaming services, ordering food delivery or going without an expensive phone, can make it all add up quickly. It's amazing how much money you can spend on services like Uber Eats. This can also affect your health if you're eating too much junk food.\n\nIn my personal case, in 2021 I spent up to $600 dollars a month on Uber Eats, remember that I live in Costa Rica and with that amount of money a family can eat for up to two months. That amount of money would have been better spent on a more important expense, such as rent or paying credit cards.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with spending once a week on food delivery like Uber Eats, but when you order delivery service 3 times a day, every day of the month, that's when there is a problem.\n\n#### 3: Stop using your credit cards\n\nStopping your debt from growing can make it easier to manage. One way is to stop using credit cards.\n\nNot running up a balance while you're paying off debt can also help improve your credit utilization - or the ratio of your debt balance to your available credit - which is an important factor in calculating your credit score and interest due. The lower your credit utilization, the better it will reflect on your credit score.\n\n#### 4: Seek extra income and cash\n\nGathering extra income can increase the amount you can put toward your debt, accelerating your repayment.\n\nLook for legitimate side jobs. Some jobs can be completed in less than an hour, such as user testing for websites and apps. Others, such as freelancing, will take you longer, but can earn you more money.\n\nFor example, I am a software developer and what I have done is, in my off hours I do additional work in addition to my main job, this has allowed me to generate an additional $2500, which has improved my financial situation.\n\nFinding extra money can also help you reduce expenses. And consider using some or all of a windfall, such as a tax refund or a bonus from work, to make a one-time payment on debt.\n\n#### 5: Find a payment method to stick to\n\nPaying off debt is a financial and psychological commitment. Just as you have to have the money to pay what you owe, you also have to find a payment method that works for you.\n\nIf a few small quick wins early in the process will help keep you motivated, the debt snowball method may be right for you. With this tactic, you allocate as much extra money as you can to pay off the smallest debt first (while covering at least the minimums on the other debts). Once paid off, you invest the money that had been earmarked for the first debt into paying off the next largest debt, and so on, until all debts are paid off.\n\nBut if you're more into delaying gratification and [saving a little money](https://taxmustache.com/mortgage-calculator), the debt avalanche method may be for you. With this strategy, you focus on paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first. Always focusing on wiping out the debt with the highest interest can save you money overall and can also speed up your debt-free date.\n\n#### 6: Consider Debt Consolidation\n\nBundling multiple debts into one payment (ideally with a lower interest rate) through debt consolidation can make your debt easier to manage and less costly overall. The less you have to pay in interest, the more money you can put toward reducing the underlying debt.\n\nA credit card with a 0% interest balance transfer or a debt consolidation loan are two solid options for debt consolidation. Keep in mind that you will likely need a good credit score to qualify for them. Also, each lender sets its own requirements, and credit score may be just one piece of the puzzle.\n\n#### 7: Know when to quit\n\nSometimes debt can be too much. If you're finding it difficult to keep [paying](https://taxmustache.com/posts/ability-to-pay-taxation) your debts and your total debt exceeds 50% of your gross annual income, it may be time to seek outside help.\n\nDebt relief options, such as debt management plans from a nonprofit credit counseling agency and bankruptcy, can give you the relief you need to put your debts behind you. Otherwise, paying off what you owe could take years and get in the way of other financial goals, such as saving for retirement or a down payment on a home.\n\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://taxmustache.com/posts/how-to-pay-off-debt\" />","slug":"how-to-pay-off-debt"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"2023 Mortgage Rates: What to Expect and How to Prepare","description":"Stay ahead of the game in 2023!

Instead, they turn to a mortgage, which is a loan to buy a house with a credit model, which usually has low interest rates (depending on many factors). After making a down payment of between 3% and 25%, they obtain a mortgage to cover the remaining costs of the home [purchase](/posts/ability-to-pay-taxation).\n\n\n### Important\n\n> Mortgages are established in such a way that the loan is amortized over a certain period agreed between the financial entity and the debtor, called term. The most common term for a mortgage is 30 years.\n\nEach payment includes a combination of principal and interest, as well as property taxes and, if necessary, mortgage insurance (homeowner's insurance may be included, or the homeowner may pay the insurer directly). When deciding to take a mortgage loan, the main thing is the original amount of money you borrowed, while the interest is what you are charged for borrowing the money.\n\n### **How do mortgage rates work in the United States?**\n\nThe mortgage rate a lender offers you is determined by a mix of factors that are unique to the lender and larger forces beyond the lender's control.\n\nLenders have a prime rate that takes into account the most important factors and provides them with a certain profit. They adjust that prime rate up or down for each borrower based on perceived risk. If you seem like a safe bet to a lender, they are more likely to offer you a lower interest rate.\n\nFor that reason, having an excellent credit score is vitally important to accessing mortgage loans with a low interest rate and better terms.\n\n#### **Factors you can control**\n\nThis is a list of factors that anyone interested in acquiring a mortgage should take into account. These are factors that fall into the \"controllable\" category, since in many cases they depend on your payment behavior with other financial commitments you have or have had in the past.\n\n#### **Your credit score**\n\nMortgage lenders use credit scores to assess risk. Higher scores are considered safer. In other words, the lender is more confident that you will be able to meet your mortgage payments.\n\n#### **The down payment on the house**\n\nPaying a higher percentage of the home's price up front reduces the amount you borrow and makes you appear less risky to lenders. You can calculate your loan-to-value ratio to see for yourself. An LTV of 80% or more is considered high.\n\n#### **Your type of loan**\n\nThe type of loan you apply for can influence the mortgage rate offered by different lenders. For example, jumbo loans tend to have higher interest rates.\n\n#### **The use to which the home will be put**\n\nMortgages for primary residences - a place where you will actually live - tend to have lower interest rates than mortgages for vacation properties, second homes or investment properties.\n\nWe have already seen some of the most common factors that fall into the category of \"factors we can control\", we have seen that the credit score is of vital importance to access a mortgage loan and also that the loan comes with a low interest rate and good payment terms.\n\n#### **Factors you cannot control**\n\nWe have already seen that there are factors that, as individuals, we can control, since they are linked to our behavior and financial responsibility. However, there are macroeconomic factors that are not within our responsibilities and are mainly issues that depend on the national economy and the influence of foreign markets.\n\n#### **The U.S. economy**\n\nOf course, this means Wall Street, but non-market forces (e.g., elections) can also influence mortgage rates. Changes in inflation and unemployment rates tend to put pressure on interest rates.\n\n#### **The global economy**\n\nWhat happens in the world will influence U.S. markets. Global political concerns may push mortgage rates lower. Good news can push rates higher.\n\n#### **The Federal Reserve**\n\nThe nation's central bank is trying to guide the economy with the twin goals of encouraging job growth and keeping inflation in check. The Federal Open Market Committee's decisions to raise or lower short-term interest rates can cause lenders to raise or lower mortgage rates.\n\nIt is a good idea to seek pre-approval from at least three lenders. With a pre-approval, lenders verify some of the details of your finances, so both the rates offered and the amount you'll be able to borrow will be actual figures. Each lender will provide you with a Budget. These standardized forms make it easy to compare lenders' interest rates and fees.\n\nWhen comparing rates, you will typically see two figures: the interest rate and the APR. The APR, or annual percentage rate, is usually the higher of the two because it takes into account both the interest rate and other costs associated with the loan (such as lender fees). As a result, the APR is often considered a more accurate measure of the cost of the loan.\n\n### **Frequently asked questions related to mortgages**\n\nThere are terminologies and processes that we know can be complicated to understand. That is why at TaxMustache.com we have decided to add a FAQ section, which we are updating every month, so that you can have more information related to mortgages in the United States.\n\n#### **What is the difference between the interest rate and APR?**\n\nThe interest rate is the percentage the lender charges for lending you money. The APR, or annual percentage rate, is supposed to reflect a more accurate cost of borrowing. The APR calculation includes fees and discount points, along with the interest rate.\n\nThe APR is a tool used to compare loan offers, even if they have different interest rates, fees and discount points. The APR takes into account ongoing expenses, such as mortgage insurance, so it is usually higher than the interest rate.\n\n#### **What are discount points?**\n\nDiscount points are basically prepaid interest that reduce the interest rate on your mortgage. A discount point costs 1% of the loan amount and typically reduces the interest rate by 0.25%.\n\nPurchasing points is optional. Watch for them, as a lender may add points to a loan offer to make your interest rate appear more competitive. It's up to you to decide if it's worth paying points as part of your closing costs.\n\nThe impact of a 0.25% interest rate change depends on the loan amount, term and interest rates. To illustrate, let's look at a $250,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and the payment differences between a 4% interest rate and a 4.25% interest rate.\n\nAt 4%, the principal and monthly interest cost $1,193.54. At 4.25%, the principal and monthly interest cost $1,229.85. Therefore, for a $250,000 mortgage with a 30-year term, reducing the interest rate from 4.25% to 4% saves $36.31 per month and $436 per year.\n\n#### **What is the mortgage rate lock?**\n\nMortgage rates vary not only from day to day, but from hour to hour. To know what rate you will pay, you need the rate you are offered to stop changing. The mortgage rate lock is the lender's guarantee that you will pay the agreed interest rate if you close the deal before a certain date. The locked rate will not change, no matter what happens to interest rates in the meantime.\n\nIt's a good idea to lock in the rate when you're approved for a mortgage with an interest rate you're comfortable with. Check with your loan officer about the timing of locking the rate. Ideally, the rate lock should extend a few days after the scheduled closing date, so that you can get the agreed-upon interest rate, even if the closing is delayed a few days.\n\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://taxmustache.com/posts/mortgage-rates\" />","slug":"mortgage-rates"}]
