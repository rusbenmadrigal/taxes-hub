The idea is that individuals, businesses and corporations with higher incomes can and should pay more taxes.\n\n### **Highlights**\n\n**1: The ability-to-pay principle holds that those with a greater ability to pay taxes-as measured by income and wealth-should pay more.**\n\n**2: One of the ideas behind \"ability to pay\" is that those who have enjoyed success should be willing to give a little more back to the society that helped make that success possible.**\n\n**3:Proponents of \"ability to pay\" argue that, ultimately, a single dollar means less to a wealthy person than it does to a wage earner, so the wealthy should pay more to match their sacrifice.**\n\n### **The ability-to-pay principle**\n\nAbility-to-pay taxation holds that those earning higher incomes should pay a higher percentage of that income in taxes compared to those earning less. For example, in 2020, individuals with taxable incomes below $9,875 faced a 10% tax rate, while those with taxable incomes above $518,000 faced a rate of 37%, the highest individual rate in the country. Incomes between those amounts face tax rates set by income brackets.\n\nThe idea behind ability-to-pay is that everyone should make the same sacrifice when it comes to paying taxes, and since people with more money effectively have less use for a given dollar, paying more of them in taxes does not impose a greater burden. Think of it this way: For a person making $1 million a year, $10,000 will make very little difference in his or her lifetime, while it will make a big difference for a person making only $60,000 a year.\n\n### **History of the Ability-to-Pay Tax**\n\nThe idea of a progressive income tax - that is, that people with the ability to pay more pay a higher percentage of their income - is centuries old. In fact, it was advocated by none other than Adam Smith, considered the father of economics, in 1776.\n\nSmith wrote: \"The subjects of every State ought to contribute to the support of the government, as far as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the income they respectively enjoy under the protection of the State.\"\n\n### **Arguments in favor of progressive taxation.**\n\nProponents of ability-to-pay taxes argue that those who have benefited most from the nation's way of life in the form of higher incomes and greater wealth can afford and should be required to pay back a little more to keep the system going.\n\nThe argument is that the society that government tax revenues have helped build-infrastructure such as highways and fiber optic communications networks, a strong military, public schools, a free market system-provides the environment in which their success is possible and in which they can continue to enjoy that success.\n\n### **Criticism of ability-to-pay taxes**\n\nCritics of progressive taxation argue that it is fundamentally unfair. They say it penalizes hard work and success and reduces the incentive to earn more money. Many argue that everyone should pay the same income tax - a \"flat tax\" - to make the system more equitable.\n\n### **Progressive taxation and inequality**\n\nAlthough the United States continues to maintain a progressive tax system, tax rates for the wealthy have plummeted in recent decades. When President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, the top personal income tax bracket was 70%. In 2020, the top rate for incomes is 37%. Meanwhile, inequality has reached levels not seen in at least a century. The richest 1% now own more wealth than the poorest 90%.","slug":"ability-to-pay-taxation"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Discover Current mortgage rates 2023","date":"2023-05-04T01:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/post/mortage.jpeg","categories":["mortgages"],"featured":true,"draft":false},"content":"\nIn this article, we explain everything related to the process of buying a home in the United States through a mortgage. In addition, our experts have added useful tips that you should take into account before signing an agreement with the bank.\n\n### **What is a mortgage?**\n\nMost people do not have the money to buy a house outright. Instead, they turn to a mortgage, which is a loan to buy a house with a credit model, which usually has low interest rates (depending on many factors). After making a down payment of between 3% and 25%, they obtain a mortgage to cover the remaining costs of the home purchase.\n\nMortgages are established in such a way that the loan is amortized over a certain period agreed between the financial entity and the debtor, called term. The most common term for a mortgage is 30 years. \n\nEach payment includes a combination of principal and interest, as well as property taxes and, if necessary, mortgage insurance (homeowner's insurance may be included, or the homeowner may pay the insurer directly). When deciding to take a mortgage loan, the main thing is the original amount of money you borrowed, while the interest is what you are charged for borrowing the money.\n\n### **How do mortgage rates work in the United States?**\n\nThe mortgage rate a lender offers you is determined by a mix of factors that are unique to the lender and larger forces beyond the lender's control.\n\nLenders have a prime rate that takes into account the most important factors and provides them with a certain profit. They adjust that prime rate up or down for each borrower based on perceived risk. If you seem like a safe bet to a lender, they are more likely to offer you a lower interest rate.\n\nFor that reason, having an excellent credit score is vitally important to accessing mortgage loans with a low interest rate and better terms.\n\n#### **Factors you can control**\n\nThis is a list of factors that anyone interested in acquiring a mortgage should take into account. These are factors that fall into the \"controllable\" category, since in many cases they depend on your payment behavior with other financial commitments you have or have had in the past.\n\n#### **Your credit score**\n\nMortgage lenders use credit scores to assess risk. Higher scores are considered safer. In other words, the lender is more confident that you will be able to meet your mortgage payments.\n\n#### **The down payment on the house**\n\nPaying a higher percentage of the home's price up front reduces the amount you borrow and makes you appear less risky to lenders. You can calculate your loan-to-value ratio to see for yourself. An LTV of 80% or more is considered high.\n\n#### **Your type of loan**\n\nThe type of loan you apply for can influence the mortgage rate offered by different lenders. For example, jumbo loans tend to have higher interest rates.\n\n#### **The use to which the home will be put**\n\nMortgages for primary residences - a place where you will actually live - tend to have lower interest rates than mortgages for vacation properties, second homes or investment properties.\n\nWe have already seen some of the most common factors that fall into the category of \"factors we can control\", we have seen that the credit score is of vital importance to access a mortgage loan and also that the loan comes with a low interest rate and good payment terms.\n\n#### **Factors you cannot control**\n\nWe have already seen that there are factors that, as individuals, we can control, since they are linked to our behavior and financial responsibility. However, there are macroeconomic factors that are not within our responsibilities and are mainly issues that depend on the national economy and the influence of foreign markets. \n\n#### **The U.S. economy**\n\nOf course, this means Wall Street, but non-market forces (e.g., elections) can also influence mortgage rates. Changes in inflation and unemployment rates tend to put pressure on interest rates.\n\n#### **The global economy**\n\nWhat happens in the world will influence U.S. markets. Global political concerns may push mortgage rates lower. Good news can push rates higher.\n\n#### **The Federal Reserve**\n\nThe nation's central bank is trying to guide the economy with the twin goals of encouraging job growth and keeping inflation in check. The Federal Open Market Committee's decisions to raise or lower short-term interest rates can cause lenders to raise or lower mortgage rates.\n\nIt is a good idea to seek pre-approval from at least three lenders. With a pre-approval, lenders verify some of the details of your finances, so both the rates offered and the amount you'll be able to borrow will be actual figures. Each lender will provide you with a Budget. These standardized forms make it easy to compare lenders' interest rates and fees.\n\nWhen comparing rates, you will typically see two figures: the interest rate and the APR. The APR, or annual percentage rate, is usually the higher of the two because it takes into account both the interest rate and other costs associated with the loan (such as lender fees). As a result, the APR is often considered a more accurate measure of the cost of the loan.\n\n### **Frequently asked questions related to mortgages**\n\nThere are terminologies and processes that we know can be complicated to understand. That is why at TaxMustache.com we have decided to add a FAQ section, which we are updating every month, so that you can have more information related to mortgages in the United States.\n\n#### **What is the difference between the interest rate and APR?**\n\nThe interest rate is the percentage the lender charges for lending you money. The APR, or annual percentage rate, is supposed to reflect a more accurate cost of borrowing. The APR calculation includes fees and discount points, along with the interest rate.\n\nThe APR is a tool used to compare loan offers, even if they have different interest rates, fees and discount points. The APR takes into account ongoing expenses, such as mortgage insurance, so it is usually higher than the interest rate.\n\n#### **What are discount points?**\n\nDiscount points are basically prepaid interest that reduce the interest rate on your mortgage. A discount point costs 1% of the loan amount and typically reduces the interest rate by 0.25%.\n\nPurchasing points is optional. Watch for them, as a lender may add points to a loan offer to make your interest rate appear more competitive. It's up to you to decide if it's worth paying points as part of your closing costs.\n\nThe impact of a 0.25% interest rate change depends on the loan amount, term and interest rates. To illustrate, let's look at a $250,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and the payment differences between a 4% interest rate and a 4.25% interest rate.\n\nAt 4%, the principal and monthly interest cost $1,193.54. At 4.25%, the principal and monthly interest cost $1,229.85. Therefore, for a $250,000 mortgage with a 30-year term, reducing the interest rate from 4.25% to 4% saves $36.31 per month and $436 per year.\n\n#### **What is the mortgage rate lock?**\n\nMortgage rates vary not only from day to day, but from hour to hour. To know what rate you will pay, you need the rate you are offered to stop changing. The mortgage rate lock is the lender's guarantee that you will pay the agreed interest rate if you close the deal before a certain date. The locked rate will not change, no matter what happens to interest rates in the meantime.\n\nIt's a good idea to lock in the rate when you're approved for a mortgage with an interest rate you're comfortable with. Check with your loan officer about the timing of locking the rate. Ideally, the rate lock should extend a few days after the scheduled closing date, so that you can get the agreed-upon interest rate, even if the closing is delayed a few days.","slug":"mortgage-rates"}]
